# Mini_Matlab
The objective of this project is to develop a customized compiler that mimics key functions of Matlab, providing an environment capable of executing complex mathematical operations, including arithmetic, trigonometric, logarithmic, and matrix operations. This compiler aims to bridge the gap between high-level programming and efficient execution, while allowing for easy extension with additional functions to meet user-specific needs. By offering a lightweight and flexible alternative to Matlab, the project will provide an accessible platform for mathematical computations and help users tailor the functionality to suit a variety of use cases.
